Hi! I'm Chris, a software engineer and outdoor enthusiast living in Boulder, CO.

I currently work at CA Technologies, formerly Rally Software, where I do 
mostly back-end development work.

In my free time I enjoy the mountains of Colorado as much as possible by participating
in sports such as:
* Skiing (backcountry, cross-country, and a bit of resort)
* Climbing
* Hiking
* Cycling
