Hi! I'm Chris, a software engineer and outdoor enthusiast living in Boulder, CO.

I currently work at [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com), where I focus on providing
monitoring and observability.

Previously I worked at [FreshTracks.io](https://freshtracks.io), an accelerator
within CA Technologies focused on building a hosted monitoring solution for
Kubernetes.

In my free time I enjoy the mountains of Colorado as much as possible by participating
in sports such as:
* Skiing (backcountry, cross-country, and a bit of resort)
* Climbing
* Hiking
* Cycling
