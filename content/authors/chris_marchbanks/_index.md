Hi! I'm Chris, a software engineer and outdoor enthusiast living in Boulder, CO.

I am a member of the [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) team, and am
passionate about all things observability. Currently I work at
[Splunk](https://www.splunk.com), where I focus on providing an internal
observability platform for Splunk Cloud.

Previously I worked at FreshTracks.io, an accelerator
within CA Technologies focused on building a hosted monitoring solution for
Kubernetes.

In my free time I enjoy the mountains of Colorado as much as possible by participating
in sports such as:

* Skiing (backcountry, cross-country, and a bit of resort)
* Climbing
* Hiking
* Cycling
