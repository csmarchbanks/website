title: "Cortex 101: Horizontally Scalable Long Term Storage for Prometheus"
event: KubeCon NA
abstract: >
  Cortex provides horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant, long
  term storage for Prometheus metrics, and a horizontally scalable,
  Prometheus-compatible query API. Cortex allows users to deploy a centralised,
  globally aggregated view of all their Prometheus instances, storing data
  indefinitely. In this talk we will discuss Cortex's history, Cortex's
  architecture, and how to get started with Cortex. Cortex is a CNCF sandbox
  project.
