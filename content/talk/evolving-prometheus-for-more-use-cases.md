title: Evolving Prometheus for More Use Cases
event: KubeCon NA 2021
abstract: >
  Prometheus is a well-known CNCF Graduated project that allows cheap and
  effective monitoring capabilities using metrics. With a rich ecosystem of
  exporters and integrations, Prometheus allows you to collect metrics from your
  applications running in Kubernetes and beyond in no time. There were many
  opportunities to learn about Prometheus, its data model and capabilities at
  every past KubeCon around the globe. This talk will be different.


  As the cloud-native ecosystem evolves and more organizations adopt
  cloud-native approaches, all projects are innovating and seeking improvements.
  We mean things like Kubernetes clusters “as cattle”, multi-cluster
  applications, eBPF, edge services and more. To keep up with demands for
  different deployments and architectures, Prometheus evolves too. In this talk,
  you will learn how you can use and extend Prometheus for those different use
  cases. In addition, we will highlight advanced, experimental, or upcoming
  functionality to help with your use cases.
