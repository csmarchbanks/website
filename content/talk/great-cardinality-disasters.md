title: The Great Cardinality Disasters of Our Time
event: KubeCon NA
abstract: >
  Many Cloud Native tools generate Prometheus metrics; together they form a
  great combination to operate and monitor your infrastructure. But sometimes
  things go wrong: a quirk in the metric labels can make the volume of data
  explode, and, soon after, your Prometheus will explode too.

  Chris and Bryan will share their war-stories such as receiving 46,000
  simultaneous alerts or squashing the source of 100kB label values. Then, they
  will provide top tips to avoid this happening to your tools in the future.
